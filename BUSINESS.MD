# Marketo to Pardot Migration Analysis: Forms & Tracking Layer for SFMC

## Executive Summary

As your organization migrates to Salesforce Marketing Cloud for email and journey orchestration, a critical gap remains: form management, lead tracking, and attribution capabilities currently handled by Marketo.
This proposal evaluates Pardot as the optimal solution to fill this gap. Pardot's native Salesforce integration, purpose-built form management, and robust tracking capabilities make it the natural complement to your SFMC investment. Rather than maintaining the full Marketo platform for limited use, Pardot provides exactly what you need—sophisticated form handling, UTM tracking, progressive profiling, and first-touch attribution—at a fraction of the cost.

Key benefits include seamless data flow between Pardot, Salesforce, and SFMC via Marketing Cloud Connect, simplified maintenance compared to Marketo, and significant cost savings while preserving all critical functionality. With a 3-6 month implementation timeline, this targeted approach ensures no disruption to lead capture while reducing complexity and operational overhead.

## Current Situation

### Context
- **Primary Change**: Client migrating to Salesforce Marketing Cloud for email and journey orchestration
- **Critical Gap**: Forms, tracking, attribution, and lead capture remain out of scope
- **Current Solution**: Marketo handles these functions today
- **Decision Required**: Keep Marketo for forms/tracking OR migrate to Pardot for this specific use case

---

## Why This Gap Matters

Without form and tracking capabilities, the organization loses:
- First-touch attribution and source tracking
- Progressive profiling and data enrichment  
- UTM parameter capture at conversion point
- Hidden field functionality for passing campaign data
- Lead source tracking and normalization
- Conversion tracking for ROI reporting

---

## Solution Options Analysis

### Option 1: Pardot as Forms & Tracking Layer

#### Core Functionality Coverage

##### Activity Tracking
- Page views, form submissions, email interactions automatically tracked
- Prospect activity history with timestamps and engagement scoring
- Real-time notifications through Engagement Studio
- Unified activity view across marketing and sales via Salesforce

##### Campaign Management
- First-touch attribution focus (primary need for forms)
- Connected Campaigns for bidirectional Salesforce sync
- Campaign influence reporting through Salesforce
- Campaign hierarchy via parent-child relationships

##### UTM Parameter Tracking
- Automatic capture of all standard UTM parameters
- Custom URL parameters through custom fields
- Google Analytics connector available
- First-touch and last-touch attribution models

##### Hidden Fields & Progressive Profiling
- Hidden fields with multiple population methods (URL parameters, cookies, default values)
- Progressive profiling with conditional field display
- Dependent fields for dynamic form experiences
- Pre-population of known prospect data

## Integration Architecture

```
Web Forms (Pardot) → Salesforce CRM → Marketing Cloud Connect → SFMC
      ↓                    ↑
   Tracking &          Bidirectional
   Attribution            Sync
```

---

## Data Flow Process

1. **Pardot captures**: Form submissions, UTMs, page views, content downloads
2. **Pardot normalizes**: Lead source, campaign attribution, data standardization
3. **Pardot syncs to Salesforce**: Real-time prospect records with complete tracking
4. **SFMC accesses**: Via Salesforce Data Extensions or Marketing Cloud Connect
5. **Journey Builder triggers**: Based on Pardot form submissions or score changes

---

## Advantages of Pardot for This Use Case

- **Purpose-Built**: Excels at form management, tracking, and attribution
- **Native Integration**: Seamless data flow to both Salesforce and SFMC
- **Cost-Effective**: Only need basic tier for form functionality
- **Proven Pattern**: Many organizations use Pardot + SFMC combination successfully
- **Simpler Learning Curve**: Easier than Marketo for focused use case
- **Lower TCO**: More predictable pricing, not based on database size

---

## Potential Limitations

- Less flexibility than Marketo for custom objects
- API limits more restrictive (25,000/day max)
- Simpler scoring models
- Some advanced Marketo features require workarounds

---

### Option 2: Maintain Marketo for Forms/Tracking

#### Flexibility Advantages

##### Superior Customization
- **Custom Objects**: Unlimited custom objects with complex relationships
- **Velocity Scripting**: Dynamic content based on complex logic
- **Advanced Tokens**: Complex personalization and data transformation
- **API Capabilities**: 50,000+ API calls/day, REST, Bulk, and streaming APIs

---

#### Advanced Features
- Nested programs with complex trigger logic
- Advanced wait steps with conditions
- Built-in multi-touch attribution models
- Complex data transformations

---

## When Marketo Flexibility Matters

Marketo remains superior for:
- Multiple product lines with different sales cycles
- Complex partner/channel marketing needs
- Global operations requiring regional customization
- Non-standard attribution requirements
- Heavy custom integrations

#### Considerations for Keeping Marketo

---

**Pros:**
- ✅ No migration disruption or data loss
- ✅ Preserve existing templates, programs, scoring models
- ✅ Team retains existing expertise
- ✅ Maximum flexibility for future needs

**Cons:**
- ❌ Higher ongoing costs for limited use
- ❌ Overkill for just forms and tracking
- ❌ More technical resources needed
- ❌ Complex maintenance for simple use case

---

## Alternative Options

### Marketing Cloud Landing Pages (CloudPages)
- **Pros**: Already included in SFMC license
- **Cons**: Lacks robust tracking and attribution features, requires custom development

### Salesforce Web-to-Lead
- **Pros**: Free with Salesforce, simple setup
- **Cons**: Very basic, no progressive profiling, limited to 500 submissions/day

### Third-Party Form Tools
- **Examples**: Formstack, Typeform with custom integration
- **Cons**: Requires building attribution logic separately, complex data flow

---

## Migration Considerations

### If Choosing Pardot

---

#### Migration Timeline
- **Phase 1** (Month 1-2): Setup and configuration
- **Phase 2** (Month 2-3): Form recreation and testing
- **Phase 3** (Month 3-4): Data migration and training
- **Phase 4** (Month 4-6): Gradual cutover and optimization

---

#### Key Migration Tasks
- Export historical data from Marketo
- Rebuild forms and landing pages in Pardot
- Translate automation logic between platforms
- Configure tracking and attribution rules
- Establish data sync with SFMC
- Train team on new platform

---

#### Critical Success Factors
- Clear governance between Pardot and SFMC responsibilities
- Defined data flow and system of record
- Proper UTM parameter standards
- Lead routing and assignment rules
- Integration testing across all systems
